# MATH-215
MATH 215: Computational Linear Algebra at BYU

Homework and starter code for this class are given in Google Colab Notebooks, but other IDEs are allowed.
Starting with Project 9, I took my work off of Google Colab and used PyCharm instead. 

Note/Disclaimer - I have not figured out all of these problems.
Problems that need to be fixed will be marked with a TODO statement and details, if I have any, of the issues.
